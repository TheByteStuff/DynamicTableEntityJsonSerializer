DynamicTableEntityJsonSerializer/Deserializer for use with Microsoft Azure Cosmos Table & Azure Table Storage.  

Based on the nuget package offered by DoguArslan (https://www.nuget.org/packages/DynamicTableEntityJsonSerializer) which uses Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.Table and .Net Framework 4.5, this package is adapted from the original work to function using Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos.Table to enable working with the Microsoft Azure CosmosDB Table API as well as the Azure Table Styorage API and a broader .NetStandard 2.0.
